The Secret Garden Project

The Secret Garden Project is a Python-based simulation that visualizes the lifecycles and interactions of various creatures in a mystical garden using Matplotlib.

Key Features:
- Lifecycle simulation of butterflies, ants, and ladybirds, with each stage represented by unique colors.
- Day & night cycle to show time progression.
- Realistic rainfall simulation for a certain duration.
- Ant behavior simulation: Larvae, pupae, and adults feed on underground fungi and dig tunnels.
- The simulation runs through various timesteps, dynamically updating the scene to reflect changes in animal growth, weather, and time of day.

Built with Python & Matplotlib (Pyplot).
